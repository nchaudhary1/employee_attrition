# employee_attrition



- Skills used: Python, Pandas, sklearn, Matplotlib, K nearest Neighbour
  
- Project Objective: Using machine learning to predict employee attrition in Python, We use linear Regression, and Decision Tree Regressor as a classifier for employee attrition and measure the accuracy of models that are built.
  
- Quantifiable Result: We could predict Employee Attrition using a linear regression model.

- The accuracy of the KNN model is 91%

- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns.
- The selected best model is based on train and test performance.
